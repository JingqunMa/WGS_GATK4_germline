Make a pipeline to call germline variants (Indel and SNP)
-input: raw fastq files from illumina reads
-process: include fastqc quality check, bwa mapping, reads deduplication and pre-processing for GATK4, GATK hyplotypecaller, VSQR for variants filtration. 
-output: VCF files for the combined input samples
-todo: include hardfilter instead of VSQR incase the read depth is low, incooperat other sequencing type, ie., WES, Gene panel. 

-method: will use snakemake to make the pipelines.
